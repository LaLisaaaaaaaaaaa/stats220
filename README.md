## Composition of Photography

### Three common composition 👍
1. *Rule of Thirds:* Divide the frame into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines, creating a grid. Important elements of the scene are then placed along these lines or at their intersections, rather than in the center
2. *Leading Lines:* They are lines within an image that lead the viewer's eye towards a specific focal point or subject.
3. *Framing:* Framing involves using elements within the scene, such as archways, windows, branches, or doorways, to frame the main subject of the photograph.
